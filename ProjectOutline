INTRO) //Source of Data: https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/50per.html#2018 This is the 50th Percentile Rent Estimate Data collected by the Office of Policy Department and Research. We are interested in this data because we want to measure how the average rent cost over the various regions of the US have changed over time, by analyzing the rent price over a period of years: 2003,2008,2013,2018 and 2023. The data includes the rent price for numerous counties across the US, and the data was grouped by state by averaging the rent price of all counties in the state and obtaining one value for the 50th percentile rent estimate for each state. This data was again grouped by region where it will be graphed and the highest and lowest regions for rent will be analyzed and percent change of rent price across each region from one 5 year period to another can be determined. In short, our main question is: What region of the US has the highest rent? And has this always been the highest rent region for the entire decade, and if not, how did changes in the other regions lead to displacing the most expensive region for rent?
DATA) The data was read in and the average rent prices of all the counties available for each state were averaged to come up with an average 50th percentile rent estimate for each state. Our variables were: rent price, and region. Rent price includes the rent price for 3 bedroom households or apartments specifically, since the data was filtered to only include the 50th percentile rent price estimate for 3 bedroom enclosures (instead of 0-4 bedroom enclosures). Some plots that may be included include: a map graph of the United States, grouped by region instead of state like is shown here. The second plot to be included would be the ggridges density plot in a stacked format for each of the five years to have a visual depiction of the change over time for each region. The last graph depicted would be a stacked box plot for each region, showing 5 box plots for the 5 different years and 1 region in one graph for another visual depiction per region, this time. The basic code for the map and the density graph is included.

```{r}
library(maps)
library(ggplot2)
year_2003$region <- tolower(state.name)  
states <- map_data("state")     
map <- merge(states, year_2003, by = "region", all.x = T)  
map_03 <- map[order(map$order), ]     
ggplot(map_03, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +  
    geom_polygon(aes(fill = rent_03)) +   
    geom_path() + 
    scale_fill_gradientn(colours = rev(heat.colors(10))) +
    coord_map() +
    labs(x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude", 
         title = "Rent Prices by State", 
         subtitle = "3 Bedroom in 2003") +
    guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Rent Price")) 
 ```
 
 ```{r}
 library(ggridges)
ggplot(year_2008, aes(x = rent_08, y = region, fill = region)) +
    geom_density_ridges() +
    theme_ridges() +                              
    theme(legend.position = "none",                  
          axis.title.x = element_text(hjust = 0.5),  
          axis.title.y = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + 
    labs(x = "Rent Price", y = "Region",  
         title = "Rent Prices by Region", subtitle = "3 Bedroom in 2008") 
  ```

METHODS) Reading the graphs we would perform different analyses based on which region acted which way. For instance, if the Midwest region was more expensive in 2003 and 2008 but then the Northeast region proved to be the most expensive for the remainder of the years, then the percent change would be analyzed to see how much the Northeast changed over the 5 years we have data for, versus how much the Midwest changed. We could compare these percent changes, as well as the percent changes from the other regions, to determine which region increased the most economically for their 50th percentile rent estimate of 3-bedroom residences, versus which region changed the least. If additional analysis is needed: we could also take the average rent price estimate across all the states in the US for each year and calculate the percent change from year to year (for the 5 years we have data for), to determine between which years the rent price estimate for 3-bedroom residences increased the most [if we did this we would add a graph to represent this data].

DISCUSSION) Some points that would be mentioned: which region showed the highest percentile rent estimate for each year; the percent change in mean percentile rent estimate for each region across each year, and which region had the most percent change from 2003 to 2023 as well as for all the years in between, and which region had the least percent change; which year showed the greatest percent change across the US in rent estimates. There are no additional visuals that we think would be helpful at this time, besides the ones mentioned above.

CONCLUSION) blank.
